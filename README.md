# FoodApp 🍤🍳<img src="https://github.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/blob/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">
This is a small website where you can consult and create healthy cooking recipes👨‍🍳🤸🧘‍♂️.

It is elaborated with a theme from Ratatuille a pixar movie, 🐀👩‍🍳 On the first page we have a button, which takes us to the second route where we can filter and consult the API recipes 👨‍💻 where they are displayed in cards, name, image, score, and ingredients in addition to having paged to change the recipes 😁 In the following route we have the option to add a new recipe, so I made a form to have the inputs to fill the database with steps, ingredients, name and diet to which the new recipe will belong

## So we will all be a Chefcito like Ratatouille🐀👩‍🍳

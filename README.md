# Food APPI 

# It is a small website where you can consult and create healthy recipes

## On the first page there is a button that directs you to the route where you can filter and read the API recipes where you can accommodate it thanks to your filter and move through the different pages through its paging.

## You can be quite a little chef like ratatouille

## In the navigation bar you can go to create a new recipe, where I made a form to have the inputs to collect the information of the new recipe
